"""
SQLite store for Valheim play sessions, deaths and server concurrency.

Free, open-source, lightweight — a single .db file via Python's built-in sqlite3,
no server process. The monitor records events here; stats_site.py renders the
public page from it.

Schema
------
play_sessions   one row per continuous play session (login -> logout)
    id, player, login_at, logout_at (NULL = still open), last_seen_at,
    deaths (count during the session), source,
    duration_seconds  -- GENERATED: seconds online, capped at last_seen_at while open
deaths          one row per death
    id, player, died_at, session_id
concurrency     one row per change in the online count (for "most online at once")
    id, at, count
meta            key/value (last_event_at, schema_version, …)

All timestamps are unix epoch seconds. Log timestamps are parsed as the server's
wall clock; durations are differences so the timezone cancels out.
